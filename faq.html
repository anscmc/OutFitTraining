                      <div class="slideBox">
                          <p class="faqP slideBox">It began almost a decade ago as Founder, Randy Hetrick's, Mobile marketing initiative at TRX® Dubbed “TRX on Tour,” and manned by TRX Master Trainers, these tricked-out mobile sprinter vans, delivered amazing “flash mob” style group workouts all across the country for over two years. However, delivering such experiences on a grand scale was a pipe-dream in the technological landscape of the time. But Randy dreamed that, one day, the tech might catch up to the concept.
                          <br><br>
                          Fast-forward ten years. Technology had evolved to power the likes of MindBody, Classpass, and Uber. The time had finally arrived. Randy’s dream of delivering TRX’s incredible training experiences into neighborhoods across America was finally a realistic possibility.
                          <br><br>
                          Then along came COVID-19. Instantly, many of the fitness industry’s most seasoned innovators found themselves out of work — casualties of the COVID shutdown and the layoffs that followed. In what might otherwise have taken years, OutFit’s “Dream Team” — with more than a century of Industry experience between them — coalesced to launch the most path-breaking fitness venture in decades.
                          <br><br>
                          <span>Built and tested in the cold of the North</span><br>
                          In the cold north of Pennsylvania stands one of the country’s great unsung manufacturing cities, Erie, PA — the place where key members of OutFit’s sales and operations team call home. Erie is where its Vans and Outposts are built, tested, and made ready for service in streets across the country. It is also OutFit’s R&amp;D lab, where equipment and workout protocols are tested against the bitter cold of winter and the stifling heat of summer. The very first OutFit workouts were delivered to our excited first customers, “OutFitters” one and all, in chilly temperatures and three feet of snow on the ground.
                          <br><br>
                          <span>Launched with pride in a city full with belief</span><br>
                          The City of Plantation, Florida became OutFit’s first stop outside Erie, PA. The match couldn’t have been more perfect. Entrepreneurship, health, fitness, and service to the community—the cornerstones of OutFit’s culture—were equally shared by Mayor Lynn Stoner, the City Council, and the people of Plantation. 
                              <br>
                              <br>
                          Plantation’s people were as warm as the Florida sunshine. They embraced OutFit—with its charter to train the city’s 1st Responders and their families free of charge — from the day we opened. And the business took off. 
                            <br>
                              <br>
Close on the heels of Plantation, the City of Fort Lauderdale welcomed OutFit with open arms — as did Wilton Manners, Sunrise, Davie, and others — each queuing up to bring the benefits of OutFit to their citizens and 1st Responders. 
 <br>
                              <br>
With the generous support of those progressive, entrepreneurial cities in South Florida, OutFit is on a roll.

Responsible for achieving subscription and revenue goals for the assigned territory, and for building lasting relationships with the members living within that territory. A successful OIC not only provides exquisite care for existing subscribers but devotes equal energy to soliciting new business.
